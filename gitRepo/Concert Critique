First attend DXARTS Spring Concert on Wednesday, May 21, 2025 - 7:30pm in Katharyn Alvord Gerlich Theater (Meany Hall).
Then, write a 500 word formal paper addressing AT LEAST ONE of the following questions:
	•	How do these pieces relate to the repertoire (musical examples) we've been studying in 461/2?
	•	Choose one piece from the concert and compare this to one piece from our repertoire.  How does the overall composition evolve?  What are spectral qualities that are similar, and how do the techniques compare?
	•	How might you create an algorithm to make one of these pieces?
 
Submit your critique as a text file (.doc, .docx, .txt, .rtf) to your git repo
	•	YourLastName_462_Critique.doc

Out of John Chowning’s work, Turenas has always had the biggest impact on me. While each of his pieces has left a resounding impact in audio synthesis and music, Turenas sticks out to me for its technical impact as well as its enjoyable composition. The progressions throughout Turenas draw the listener in, with ambisonic inflections pulling tones back and forth across your field of hearing. Seemingly random or semi-random bouncing tones are a staple of the song, oftentimes not adhering to the typical 12-note scale of Western Music Theory. I believe that breaking from the mold of Western music theory in this way is an invaluable aspect of composition often displayed in our class repertoire, and is a vital aspect of many of the pieces that we study. This piece represents a valuable facet of my perception of the Dxarts class repertoire and the music contained therein, both due to the timing of its introduction to me as well as it’s value to the medium. A part of these pieces that I believe Chowning represents beautifully in Turenas is a sense of anticipation: while much music has anticipatory qualities, I believe that many of the pieces we listen to in Dxarts demonstrate the utilization of this technique in a more visceral and even more impressive way. While many pieces of pop music create this anticipation via following prescribed progressions, such as chorus, verse, chorus, songs like Turenas create anticipation by breaking from this typical structure, making the listener so unsure of what to expect next that any movement is a surprise. While certain methods are repeated, trends are demonstrated, and sounds are played again, the atypical and relatively unmetered construction of Turenas lends strongly towards this anticipation. 
In creating algorithms to make a piece like Turenas, a basic facsimile of certain parts of the piece can be accomplished by applying a random scalar progression up and down certain tones, while panning these tones back and forth between stereo hemispheres. For example, the portion of Turenas around 1:35 to 2:00 contains many progressions of flittering notes, which I have repeatedly attempted to duplicate via heavy sets of do loops connected to CTK note instances. These do loops will produce between 50 to 200 notes, and applying some form of an exponential or nonlinear method to determine timing can help to mimic the increasing and decreasing rate at which Chowning plays these notes, often having increasing or decreasing timings within single professions. The application of binaural audio, fairly simply applied via methods such as panAngle in our SynthDefs, is beautifully stratified between sides in Turenas, often taking lilting lines or skittering curves between hemispheres. This further suggests the use of nonlinear mapping to these values in attempts to recreate a piece like Turenas. In utilizing Do loops to recreate sounds like these, adding an instance variable that you modulate by is a key aspect of creating these variations, allowing for iterated variations on similar sounds with wide-reaching options for modulation. By recursively referencing in-SynthDef methods via ._(variablename), this variation becomes much more optimized.  

Turenas by John Chowning is a monolith in the legacy of computer music, and its impact on music, me, and the teaching of Dxarts is invaluable. Not only defining the future of music, this piece has in some part, helped to define my future, as a musician and a programmer.
